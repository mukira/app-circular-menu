# Circular Menu

Try it on http://liwe.github.io/app-circular-menu

This is an exemple of menu interface controlled by the touch UI from [liwe](http://liwe.co). Inspired from GTA V (: radio menu) and [Sara Soueidan's circulus](http://sarasoueidan.com/tools/circulus/).

The app is playing songs from SoundCloud, selected via the circular menu. The songs are played via the share iframe. Remember, this demo is only an exemple for a circular menu. It's the reason there's no controls about the songs (play/pause) or other feature.

The playlist is a selection of my personal choice, no pull request to change it will be accepted. :-P
